<!-- 
This page contains usemin-style build blocks.  Examples are shown below.
The content of the opening tag takes the format:
    
    build:type url
        
where:

    type = css | js
    url = url of the optimized file
       
During the build phase, the contents of each build block will be replaced by a
single reference to the optimized file.  The url will be used exactly as it
appears within the opening tag. 

The css build blocks below contain a reference to less.js, which is a JavaScript
implementation of LESS run by your web browser that will process LESS code.  By
including less.js, you can include a link directly to your LESS code instead of
a CSS file.
